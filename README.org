* About
This is a bash script to automate the installation and configuration of
Emacs on =Ubuntu 22=.

You can run the script without with different flags to modify its
behavior. The available options are:

1. =-h=: Display help and exit.
2. =-p DIRECTORY= : Specify the Emacs installation directory. By
   default, it is =$HOME/emacs=.
3. =-y=: Skip all the prompts and directly install Emacs and proceed
   with the steps.
4. =-n STEPS=: Specify the steps to skip. Steps need to be
   comma-separated.

** Requirements

This script requires that you have =bash=, =git=, and =sudo= privilege. It's
designed to work on =Ubuntu 22=.

** Steps

Here are the steps that this script will perform in order:

1. =install_deps=: Install the necessary [[#list-of-packages-that-will-be-installed][dependencies]] for Emacs.
2. =kill_emacs=: Kill any running Emacs process.
3. =remove_emacs=: Uninstall Emacs and perform a clean up.
4. =pull_emacs=: Pull the latest Emacs source code.
5. =build_emacs=: Build Emacs from the source code.
6. =install_emacs=: Install Emacs from the built source code.
7. =fix_emacs_xwidgets=: Fix [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/tree/etc/PROBLEMS?h=master#n181][issue]] related to Emacs XWidgets.
8. =copy_emacs_icon=: Download and replace the default Emacs Icon with the [[https://github.com/nashamri/spacemacs-logo][Spacemacs logo]] by Nasser Alshammari.

** Usage

*** Prompt Every Step (Default)

To execute the build and installation script step-by-step, use the following command:

#+begin_src shell
bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarimAziev/build-emacs/main/build-emacs.sh)"
#+end_src

If you have already downloaded the script, simply execute:
#+begin_src shell
./build-emacs.sh
#+end_src

*** Execute All Steps Without Prompt

To execute all steps without prompting, use the =-y= argument (which assumes "yes") to each question.

#+begin_src shell
bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarimAziev/build-emacs/main/build-emacs.sh) -y"
#+end_src

Or, if you have the script downloaded:
#+begin_src shell
./build-emacs.sh -y
#+end_src

*** Execute Specific Steps
To execute specific steps, use the =-s= argument with the desired steps, separated by commas. For instance,
to only compile (=build_emacs=) and install (=install_emacs=) Emacs skipping other steps:

#+begin_src shell
bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarimAziev/build-emacs/main/build-emacs.sh) -s build_emacs,install_emacs"
#+end_src

Or, if you have the script downloaded:
#+begin_src shell
./build-emacs.sh -s build_emacs,install_emacs
#+end_src


*** Skip Certain Steps
You can also skip certain steps using the =-n= argument, followed by the steps you wish to omit.

The example below will execute all steps except installing dependencies (=install_deps=).

#+begin_src shell
bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarimAziev/build-emacs/main/build-emacs.sh) -n install_deps"
#+end_src

Or, if you have the script downloaded:
#+begin_src shell
./build-emacs.sh -n install_deps
#+end_src

*** Use a Custom Directory

To build in a custom directory, use the =-p= argument, followed by the path to your directory:

#+begin_src shell
bash -c "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KarimAziev/build-emacs/main/build-emacs.sh) -p $HOME/myemacs"
#+end_src

Or, if you have the script downloaded:
#+begin_src shell
./build-emacs.sh -p $HOME/myemacs
#+end_src
